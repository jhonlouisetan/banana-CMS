# About
This banana crop monitoring system was specifically developed to fit the de-budding, fertilizing, and harvesting process of the chosen farm. This system has functions such as calculating the harvesting date of a crop after entering the date it was de-budded, viewing the number of crops ready to be harvested each week, and monitoring the fertilizer application frequency.

# Purpose
A system made for Bartulaba-Domolok Banana Farm, and for our capstone project.
